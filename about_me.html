              >I am Omotosho Korede, an upcoming software developer.
              <br />Currently an Undergraduate in the University of Ibadan. I
              started my career few weeks ago, I have been playing around tech
              though, moving from one skill to another. I made my decision of
              becoming a programmer after going through a tough fight with my
              family, I needed something to keep me busy and at the same time
              add value to my life</i
